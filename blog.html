        1. Differences between local storage and session storage
    </h1>
    <br>
    <h3 class="fw-4 ">
        sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire,
        data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab
        in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

        2. Differences between global scope and block scope:
    </h1>
    <br>
    <h3 class="fw-4 ">
        A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces
        ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program,
        including inside blocks.

    <h1 class="text-danger fw-bold fs-1">3. Filter vs Map vs Find vs Foreach:</h1>
    <br>
    <h3 class="fw-4 ">
        Basically forEach works as a traditional for loop looping over the array and providing you array elements to do
        operations on them. The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and
        executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. Map like filter & foreach
        takes a callback and run it against every element on the array but whats makes it unique is it generate a new
        array based on your existing array. The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test.
        The find() method executes a function for each array element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements
        are found. The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.

    <h1 class="text-danger fw-bold fs-1">4. Why should you use template string in JS:</h1>
    <br>
    <h3 class="fw-4 ">
        Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate
        variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It
        allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with
        template strings are tags. Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as
        parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities.
